# SMU HPC Documentation

## Fall 2022 Workshop Series

The Fall 2022 OIT, CRC, & DSI workshop series provides a hands-on experience
that will guide researchers from the basics of using SMU's supercomputing
resources to advanced parallelization and application specific usage. The
topics will cover information useful for researchers to quickly begin to use
the advanced compute capabilities provided with the cluster. New users are
encouraged to take advantage of the introductory "Introduction to HPC" workshop
that will be given once monthly during the semester.

Fall 2022 OIT, CRC, & DSI Workshop Series - Open to All!

# Usage Statistics

## User Summary

You can find your <img src="../images/CF/usage_stats/user_summary.png" alt="User Summary" height="35"> on the top menu bar of ColdFront.
Here, you will find statistics and graphics related to your Publications, Research Outputs, Fields of Study, Allocations, and Software Used. For more detailed information, or for information about users on your projects, see instructions for [**Usage Metrics**](https://southernmethodistuniversity.github.io/hpc_docs/coldfront/usage_stats.html#usage-metrics) below.

## Usage Metrics

To see user scorecards for users on your projects:

1. Click on **Usage Metrics** > **User Statistics** in the top menu bar of ColdFront.

    ```{image} ../images/CF/usage_stats/usage_metrics.png
    :alt: Usage Metrics User Statistics
    :height: 100px
    ```

2. Filter data based on **Projects**, **PIs**, **Users**, **Departments**, and **Field of Study**. These are filters, not search bars, so make sure each filter is compatible with the next.

3. Provide a **Start Date** and **End Date** to filter the data.

4. If you wish to see historical data for user usage prior to ColdFront, select this checkbox:

    ```{image} ../images/CF/usage_stats/include_checkbox.png
    :alt: Include usage not associated with a project or allocation
    :width: 600 px
    ```

    ```{note}
    For data prior to ColdFront, your users may have usage that is not associated with your project because they used HPC for a class or another research project. Please keep this in mind and ask your users for clarification if you are unsure about their historical usage.
    ```

5. Click on <img src="../images/CF/usage_stats/search.png" alt="Search" height="35">. It will take a while for the data to load, so please be patient.

6. For each user, you will see a scorecard with statistics about their usage. Click on <img src="../images/CF/usage_stats/show_plot.png" alt="Show Plot" height="35"> to display a plot.

    ```{note}
    These plots and the plots in the **User Summary** may occassionally differ. The **Usage Metrics** are only updated at least daily.

# Project Reviews and Allocation Renewals

Continued access to SMU HPC resources requires project owners to review their project information annually in order to renew their groupâ€™s accounts.
The information provided by researchers is compiled and used to help make the case to the University for continued investment in HPC resources.
Up-to-date and accurate information is crucial to our success.

## Project Reviews

Projects are required to be reviewed yearly. We ask that you verify and update metadata associated with your project including:

- Description of the Project
- Any new publications and/or research outputs associated with the project
- Any grants or funding sources
- Any software used
- Verify the current project users are still correct

It is not required to have inputs in these fields; however, knowing how the
system is being used helps us identify future needs and justify purchases.

When a project requires review, you will be able to continue using
resources until they expire, but will not be able to request new resource allocations
or renew existing allocations until the project review is completed.
```

## Allocation Renewals

By default, most allocations are approved in 1 year intervals.
When the expiration date for an allocation is approaching, you will receive email warnings with links to renew.
On [ColdFront](https://hpcaccess.smu.edu) there will also be statuses showing upcoming expirations.

You can renew by going to the link in the email or by clicking on a button like the following on the allocation page

```

When you request a renewal, you will be asked to verify the users on the allocation.
The default is to keep all users as they currently are; however, you should remove users
who no longer need access.

```{note}
Renewing an allocation will extend the ability to use the allocation for 1 additional year.
The quotas and usage for storage allocations will remain the same. For compute allocations,
the usage will reset to 0 (for example, if you had used 40,000 CPU hours on an allocation
with 50,000 CPU hours, the allocation will reset to have 0 CPU hours used and 50,000 CPU hours
available.)
```

We aim to review renewal requests in 1 business or less, but it may occasionally take longer.
You will receive an email when the allocation renewal has been approved.

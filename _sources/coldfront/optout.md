# Opting out of notifications

:::{important} Official HPC announcements will always be sent to official SMU email address.
Failure to read or act on HPC announcements in a timely manner may result in loss of data and/or access
to HPC systems.
:::

Project owners and managers cannot opt out of email notifications since they contain important
information about their projects and allocations.

Users who are not owners or managers can opt out of most email reminders sent by ColdFront.
This must be done on a per project basis. On the project detail page, which is reachable
by clicking on the project title, simply uncheck the notifications checkbox in the **Users** section.

# NeMo Example

**Currently, the example script provided doesn't run successfully.**

## Submit jobs

Run the `submit_jobs.sh` script. The script will submit up to three jobs.

Jobs:
1. Get datasets and the NeMo repo and preprocess the data
2. Build the container image using script from NeMo
3. Run the example Python script using the container image

Steps 1 and 2 will run only if needed.

All scripts have comments detailing what they are doing.

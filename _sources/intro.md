# Welcome

The mission of the Center for Research Computing at Southern Methodist
University is to support research and education enabled by high-performance
computing technology. We are motivated by the fact that computer simulation and
data analysis has become an essential facilitator of discovery in most
disciplines, and that advances in computing, networking, and data storage
technologies are likely to accelerate this trend.

The primary purposes of the Center are to: (i.) provide a state-of-the-art
research computing infrastructure for SMU faculty and students; (ii.) provide
training and support to faculty and students in the use of the Center's
resources and external facilities, including awarding certificates in
high-performance computing based on a completion of assignments associated with
center's workshops; (iii.) provide the mechanism for faculty governance of
advanced research computing and related educational activities ; (iv.)
stimulate multidisciplinary research involving computation; (v.) support and
develop educational programs involving computation; (vi.) publicize faculty and
student research involving computation; and (vii.) engage with local government
and industry on relevant research projects.

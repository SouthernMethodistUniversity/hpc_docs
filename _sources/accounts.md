# Accounts

Accounts on SMU HPC clusters can be created via the processes detailed below.

## Accounts for a Class

Accounts for classes are required to use [ColdFront](https://hpcaccess.smu.edu).
Instructors of record will be able to see their courses around the time registration
opens. ColdFront will automatically add and remove students enrolled in the course
shortly before the start of the term and periodically update during the term based on 
official enrollment data.

See the [ColdFront quick start guide for instructors](coldfront/qs_instructor.md) and
the [ColdFront quick start guide for students](coldfront/qs_student.md)

If you need help setting up a class, please contact the [Help Desk](mailto:help@smu.edu?subject=[HPC]).

## Accounts for Individuals with an SMU NetID

:::{important} As of **November 1, 2024** [running HPC jobs](coldfront/running_jobs.md) requires using a slurm account from and active active allocation in [ColdFront](https://hpcaccess.smu.edu).
See the [frequently asked questions](coldfront/faq.md)

Most benefits eligible faculty and staff can use the self-service
[ColdFront](https://hpcaccess.smu.edu) platform to create an account for 
themselves, students, and external collaborators with SMU credentials.
In order for an HPC account to be created or reactivated for an user, the following
conditions must be satisfied:

1. The user must create or be added to a project in [ColdFront](https://hpcaccess.smu.edu). 
   See [how to create a project](coldfront/add_change_project.md).
   Note that students cannot create their own projects.

2. The user must be on an active compute and/or storage allocation managed 
   by [ColdFront](https://hpcaccess.smu.edu). See [how to create an allocation](coldfront/request_change_allocation.md)


## Accounts for Individuals without an SMU NetID or Sponsored NetID

1. The sponsor must request an SMU NetID or Sponsored NetID and have that account
   activated before sponsor can request cluster access for the individual.
   Please submit an Account Request via the
   [Online Service Center](https://www.smu.edu/oit/services/stable).
   - ***Contractor with SMU email*** is the type of account to request.
2. Once the individual\'s SMU NetID or Sponsored NetID has been created and
   activated the sponsor can add them to [ColdFront](https://hpcaccess.smu.edu)
   projects and allocations.

:::{note} The HPC and Research support teams are not involved in the process of
creating SMU NetIDs or Sponsored NetIDs.

# Reset Account Password

SMU HPC clusters use SMU's authentication system, which means that your
username and password are based on your SMU credentials. Your username is the
first part of your SMU NetID, i.e. janeuser for <janeuser@smu.edu>, and
your password is your SMU password. SMU's password tool can be used to change
or reset your password (<https://pwreset.smu.edu>). However, note that this
changes your password for all SMU services such as email as well.

# Terminate an Existing Account

Please send a request to the [SMU HPC
Admins](mailto:help@smu.edu?subject=[HPC]) with a short explanation of
reason for the termination.

# Accounts

Accounts on SMU HPC clusters can be created via the processes detailed below.

## Accounts for Individuals with an SMU ID

- SMU faculty/staff can request an account by filling out the [New
  Account
  Form](https://smu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6WIK4HsRuE4N6JL).
- If you are a student or postdoc please ask your supervisor, sponsor,
  or adviser to request an account via the [New Account
  Form](https://smu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6WIK4HsRuE4N6JL).

## Accounts for Individuals without an SMU ID or Sponsored ID

1. The sponsor must request an SMU ID or Sponsored ID and have that account
   activated before sponsor can request cluster access for the individual.
   Please submit an Account Request via the
   [Online Service Center](https://help.smu.edu/User/Dashboard).
2. Once the individual\'s SMU ID or Sponsored ID has been created and
   activated the sponsor can request cluster accounts for
   the individual via the [New Account
   Form](https://smu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6WIK4HsRuE4N6JL).

# Reset Account Password

SMU HPC clusters use SMU's authentication system, which means that your
username and password are based on your SMU credentials. Your username is the
first part of your SMU email address, i.e. janeuser for <janeuser@smu.edu>, and
your password is your SMU password. SMU's password tool can be used to change
or reset your password (<https://pwreset.smu.edu>). However, note that this
changes your password for all SMU services such as email as well.

# Terminate an Existing Account

Please send a request to the [SMU HPC
Admins](mailto:help@smu.edu?subject=HPC) with a short explanation of
reason for the termination.

  Beginning February 25, 2026, SMU will be transitioning from Duo to Microsoft Authenticator for most multi-factor authentication (MFA).

  Microsoft Authenticator will be required to access the HPC OnDemand web portal and the ColdFront account management platform. SSH access to the HPC systems will continue to require DUO.

  For more information or to [opt-in early](https://smu.edu/passwordless), please visit the [Microsoft Authenticator service page](https://www.smu.edu/oit/services/microsoft-authenticator).

  If you need assistance, please contact the [IT Help Desk](https://www.smu.edu/oit/help).

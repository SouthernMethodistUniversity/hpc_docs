\section{Python Environments}

\begin{frame}{Managing Python Installations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Python environments allow users to use specific versions of Python with
the packages of their choice
\item The packages can be installed via \mintinline{sh}{conda} or
\mintinline{sh}{pip}, depending on the type of environment being used
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Anaconda Environments}
\begin{itemize}
\item Anaconda environments are managed using \mintinline{sh}{conda}, which is
available via Anaconda installations such as \mintinline{sh}{python/2} and
\mintinline{sh}{python/3} on ManeFrame II.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Anaconda Environments Example}
\begin{listing}[H]

\caption{A specific version of Python is installed along with the JupyterLab
package and its dependencies. The new environment is then loaded and then
unloaded.}
\end{listing}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Python Virtual Environments}
\begin{itemize}
\item Python 3 has native support for managing environments, which can be used
with any Python 3 installation on ManeFrame II.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\caption{A specific installation of Python, in this case from Spack, is used
and then JupyterLab and its dependencies are installed. The new environment is
then loaded and then unloaded.}

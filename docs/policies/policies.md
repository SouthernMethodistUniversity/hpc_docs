Data older than 60 days will be purged (deleted) without warning.
`$SCRATCH` is intended as high performance, temporary storage for jobs.

`$WORK` (8 TB limit) or `$HOME` directories (200 GB). If those are also
insuffiencient, please contact us to discuss options.

No two individuals should share the same HPC account, nor
should two individuals share the password of the same account. Each
individual is entitled to have their own account hence please request

Access to data tranfer nodes is available by request and legitimate need. 
These nodes are meant only for transferring large amounts data to/from HPC resources. 
They should not be used for computational jobs.

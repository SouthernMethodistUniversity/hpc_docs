# Welcome

The mission of the Center for Research Computing at Southern Methodist
University is to support research and education enabled by high-performance
computing technology. We are motivated by the fact that computer simulation and
data analysis has become an essential facilitator of discovery in most
disciplines, and that advances in computing, networking, and data storage
technologies are likely to accelerate this trend.

The primary purposes of the Center are to: (i.) provide a state-of-the-art
research computing infrastructure for SMU faculty and students; (ii.) provide
training and support to faculty and students in the use of the Center's
resources and external facilities, including awarding certificates in
high-performance computing based on a completion of assignments associated with
center's workshops; (iii.) provide the mechanism for faculty governance of
advanced research computing and related educational activities ; (iv.)
stimulate multidisciplinary research involving computation; (v.) support and
develop educational programs involving computation; (vi.) publicize faculty and
student research involving computation; and (vii.) engage with local government
and industry on relevant research projects.

# Fall 2023 Workshop Series

The Fall 2023 OIT, CRC, & DSI workshop series provides a hands-on experience
that will guide researchers from the basics of using SMU's supercomputing
resources to advanced parallelization and application specific usage. The
topics will cover information useful for researchers to quickly begin to use
the advanced compute capabilities provided with the cluster. New users are
encouraged to take advantage of the introductory "Introduction to HPC" workshop
that will be given once monthly during the semester.

Fall 2023 OIT, CRC, & DSI Workshop Series - Open to All!

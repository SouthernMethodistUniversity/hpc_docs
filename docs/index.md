# Welcome

The SMU's high-performance computing (HPC) resources (M3 and NVIDIA DGX
SuperPOD) are shared-access super computers for computational research. The
Office of Information Technology (OIT) and the O'Donnell Data Science and
Research Computing Institute (ODSRCI) work together to provide the
computational resources and tools required by SMU’s faculty, researchers, and
students to accelerate advances in research innovation.

# Upcoming Workshops - Open to All!

The ODSRCI and OIT workshops provide a hands-on experience
that will guide researchers from the basics of using SMU's supercomputing
resources to advanced parallelization and application specific usage. The
topics will cover information useful for researchers to quickly begin to use
the advanced compute capabilities provided with the cluster.

Students, faculty, or staff should register for the workshops in advance via the links below. Please bring your laptop to the workshop.

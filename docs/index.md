# Welcome

The SMU's high-performance computing (HPC) resources (M3 and NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD)
are shared-access super computers for computational research. 
The Office of Information Technology (OIT) and the O'Donnell Data Science and 
Research Computing Institute work together to provide the computational 
resources and tools required by SMUâ€™s faculty, researchers, and students to 
accelerate advances in research innovation.

# Fall 2023 Workshop Series

The Fall 2023 OIT, CRC, & DSI workshop series provides a hands-on experience
that will guide researchers from the basics of using SMU's supercomputing
resources to advanced parallelization and application specific usage. The
topics will cover information useful for researchers to quickly begin to use
the advanced compute capabilities provided with the cluster. New users are
encouraged to take advantage of the introductory "Introduction to HPC" workshop
that will be given once monthly (9/5, 10/3, 11/7; 10-12 -- 10/2, 11/6) from 1-3pm during the semester at Moody Building, room 244.

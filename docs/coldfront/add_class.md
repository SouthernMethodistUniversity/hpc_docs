These instructions will help you get access to HPC resources for your class.
If you are the instructor of record in my.smu, much of this process will be easy and automated for you.
If you are not an instructor of record for a course but would like to set up a course (e.g. workshop or bootcamp), 
please reach out to [help@smu.edu](mailto:help%40smu.edu?subject=%5BHPC%5D) and include [HPC] in the subject line.

### To add Students and Other Users

For classes, the management of students is synched hourly with class enrollment records starting a week before the semester starts.
Once in the , students that add or drop will be added or removed from your class and allocations accordingly.

```{note}
All students will appear 7 days before the semester begins.
```

If you wish to add a user who is not enrolled to your class (e.g. a co-instructor), follow the steps below.

```{note}
This is not especially common. Do not add students that will be enrolled in the course as this could disrupt their file permissions.
```

    ```{note}
    If you are adding multiple users, you can list them all in the Search String box
    ```

### To Request Additional Resource Allocations

All classes are granted a default compute allocation consisting of ***Core Usage (Hours)*** and ***Memory Usage (Hours)***.
Depending on the options chosen at the creation of the project, this may contain ***Accelerator Usage (Hours)*** or a second allocation for Storage.
The Storage allocation is Read-Only for students by default.

If you find your class needing additional resources, you can request additional allocations for either Compute or Storage, by following the instructions below.

4.	Select Submit
5.	Once complete you will see your status request as **Pending Review** under Allocations

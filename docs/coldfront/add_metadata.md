# Add Metadata

Providing any of the following data is optional has no bearing on your ability to request allocations or make projects. This is simply to help us collect better data on HPC usage and to provide you with better metrics. We greatly appreciate efforts to fill this out, as it aids our ability to provide the best HPC services for your research and classes.

## Add Grants

To add grant information that is attached to a project:

1. Go to your project page and click on <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/add_grant.png" alt="Add Grant" height="35">.

2. If you have any grants with an SMU G-Number, select the check boxes next to every grant associated with that project and click on <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/save.png" alt="Save" height="35">.

3. If your grant does not appear (as is the case with internal SMU grants), then click on <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/enter_grants_manually.png" alt="Enter Grants Manually" height="35">.

4. Provide any information that you can for the grant. **Title**, **Role**, **Funding agency**, **Grant Start Date**, **Grant End Date** are required fields. Verification source is not a required field, but could be helpful information if you are requesting larger than usual allocations.

5. Click on <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/save.png" alt="Save" height="35">.

6. On the project page, you can verify that your grant has been added to the project under <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/grants.png" alt="Grants" height="35">.

## Add Publications

To add publication information that is attached to a project:

1. Go to your project page and click on <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/add_publication.png" alt="Add Publication" height="35">.

2. If your publication has a DOI or Bibliographic Code, try searching based on those, select the checkbox next to the correct publication(s) from your search results, and click on <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/add_selected_pubs.png" alt="Add Selected Publications to Project" height="35">.

3. If your publication does not have a DOI or Bibliographic Code, you can add it manually by clicking on <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/enter_pub_manually.png" alt="Enter publication manually" height="35">.

4. Provide a **Title**, **Author(s)**, **Year**, and **Journal** for your publication and click on <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/add_pub.png" alt="Add Publication" height="35">.

5. On the project page, you can verify that your publication has been added to the project under <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/pubs.png" alt="Publications" height="35">.

## Add Research Outputs

If there are any research outputs that do not fall under the category of a publication (such as conference presentations or posters), you can add them by follow the instructions below.

1. Go to your project page and click on <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/add_output.png" alt="Add Research Output" height="35">.

2. Provide a **Title** and **Description** for your project (including any relevant links), and click on <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/save.png" alt="Save" height="35">.

3. On the project page, you can verify that your research output has been added to the project under <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/outputs.png" alt="Research Outputs" height="35">.

## Add Software Used

To add information about software used on the project:

```{admonition} Important
:class: note
Like the rest of the metadata, any software used that is added here is just for data collection purposes. You will still need to load software using `module load [software_name]` or another method on the HPC systems.
```

1. Go to your project page and click on <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/add_software.png" alt="Add Software Used" height="35">.

2. For any software available using `module load`, search the software name, select the checkbox next to the software version(s) you used, and click on <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/add_selected_software.png" alt="Add Selected Software to Project" height="35">.

3. If you are using any other software or cannot find your software using the search feature, click on <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/enter_software_manually.png" alt="Enter software manually" height="35">

4. Provide the **Software Name**, **Version**, and **Software Homepage**, then click on <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/add_soft.png" alt="Add Software" height="35">.

5. On the project page, you can verify that your software has been added to the project under <img src="../images/CF/add_metadata/software.png" alt="Software" height="35">.

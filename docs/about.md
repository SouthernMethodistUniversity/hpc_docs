# About

SMU's high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, M3 and the NVIDIA DGX
SuperPOD, feature state-of-the-art CPUs, accelerators, and networking
technologies, high memory capacity per node, and advanced interactive
experiences via the Open OnDemand Portal.

The clusters provides a familiar interactive experience for researchers,
which includes the Ubuntu Linux operating system, the SLURM resource
scheduler, and the Lmod environment module system. Additionally,
familiar development tool chains are available including the GCC, Intel,
and NVIDIA compiler suites. Optimized high-level programming environments
such as MATLAB, Python, and R are also installed in addition to the
domain specific software packages that SMU researchers depend on for
their work.

## Faculty Partner Nodes

### Professor Thomas Hagstrom (Mathematics)

Professor Hagstrom has one node that is available as part of M3. This
node has dual  AMD EPYC 7742 64-Core Processor \"Zen 2\"
processors, 512 GB of memory, and an NVIDIA A100 GPU accelerator with 
40 GB of HBM2 memory, 6912 Cuda cores, and 432 tensor cores. 

This node `amd001`, is currently available only with permision
from Dr. Hagstrom.

### Professor Barbara Minsker (Civil and Environmental Engineering)

Professor Minsker has two nodes that are availabe as part of M3. These
nodes each have dual Intel Xeon Gold 6148 2.40 GHz 20-core \"Skylake\"
processors, 384 GB of memory, dual NVIDIA V100 GPU accelerators, and 2
TB of local RAID scratch space. Each GPU has 5,120 CUDA cores, 640
Tensor cores, and 32 GB CoWoS HBM2 memory. The V100 GPU is based on the
Volta architecture and an extremely high bandwidth (900 GB/s) stacked
memory architecture.

The queue for these nodes, `fp-gpgpu-3`, is generally available to M3
users with the following restrictions.

-   The maximum job duration for users not in Dr. Minsker\'s group is 7 days
-   There is no maximum job duration for users in Dr. Minsker\'s group
    when the `--qos qos_clowder` Slurm flag is used
-   Jobs submitted without the `--qos qos_clowder` flag may be queued
    indefinitely until jobs submitted with the flag finish

### Professor Wei Cai (Mathematics)

Professor Cai has one node that is available as part of M3. This node
has dual Intel Xeon Gold 6150 2.70 GHz 18-core \"Skylake\"
processors, 384 GB of memory, dual NVIDIA V100 GPU accelerators, and 2
TB of local RAID scratch space. Each GPU has 5,120 CUDA cores, 640
Tensor cores, and 32 GB CoWoS HBM2 memory. The V100 GPU is based on the
Volta architecture and an extremely high bandwidth (900 GB/s) stacked
memory architecture.

The queue for these nodes, `fp-gpgpu-4`, is generally available to M3
users with the following restrictions.

-   The maximum job duration for users not in Dr. Cai\'s group is 7
    days
-   Members of Dr. Cai\'s group may run upto 2 weeks
    when the `--qos qos_cai` Slurm flag is used
-   Jobs submitted without the `--qos qos_cai` flag may be preempted

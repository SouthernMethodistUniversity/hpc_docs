# Torch

## Installation

Run the script `./setup_env.sh`, which will install Torch, JupyterLab,
and Pandas in a cluster-specific Python environment on either MP or M3.
The GPU version of Torch is installed on MP, while the CPU-only version
is installed on M3.

## Usage

Source the Python environment via `source ${env_dir}/bin/activate`,
where `${env_dir}` is the root installation path.

## Installing Python Packages

Users who require Python packages that are not currently installed on M2
are encouraged to utilize custom Python environments. Python environments
allow users to use specific versions of Python with the packages of their
choice. Additionally, Python environments are generally portable, which
will help to ensure that Python programs that run on M2 can also run on
other machines with minimal changes.

There are two primary ways to create virtual environments: using Python\'s
native vitrual environments or using _Conda_ environemnts.

      - **htc** - (*1-36 cores*) Use a standard M2 compute node. This reduces the wait time as there are lots of such nodes. Use this option if your project involves straightforward MATLAB computation.
      - **large-mem** - (*36 cores*) Use an M2 node that has 1,536 GB (1.5 TB) of available RAM as well as 48 cores. There are 12 of these nodes on M2. Use this option if your project involves processing of large datasets using MATLAB.
      - **GPU** - (*1-36 cores*) Use an M2 node that has an [NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU] (http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-p100.html) with an X server running in the background. This utilizes the GPU for hardware accelerated 3D visualization. There are 36 of these nodes on M2. Use this option if your project involves drawing of complicated 3D figures using MATLAB.

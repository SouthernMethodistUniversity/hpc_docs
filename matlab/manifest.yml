  This app will launch a [MATLAB] GUI on the [M2 cluster]. You will be able to interact with the MATLAB GUI through a VNC session.

  Note that the HPC OnDemand configuration of [MATLAB] runs in an interactive desktop environment requiring packages only installed on the nodes of the **`desktop`** SLURM partition, however there are [other ways to run interactive sessions] if there is a necessity to use a node in one of [the other queues].

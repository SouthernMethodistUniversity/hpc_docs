  This app will launch a Remote Desktop session from a contiainer image on [M3](https://southernmethodistuniversity.github.io/hpc_docs/about.html#maneframe-iii-m3)

  Portal jobs are interactive by nature and, therefore, limited to a maximum of 12 hours.
  If your jobs take longer, please convert them to scripts and run them in batch mode
  (i.e. non-interactively.)

  **NOTE: Apptainter (formerly Singularity) and other containers will not run in this environment.**
